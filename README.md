# Reverse Clock Time Travel üïíüåÄ

## Basic Details
### Team Name: ideas

### Team Members
- Team Lead: Abin Joy
- Member 2: Anna Joy VJ

### Project Description
A completely useless but fun web app that displays a real-time **backward-moving clock** (both analog and digital), detects your face via webcam, counts random beard/mustache hairs, and tells you what animal you were in a past life.  
It also has an inverted fake cursor and plays random animal sounds when you click.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
What if clocks moved backward? How would we ever know the right time?  
And how do we find out if you were a turtle in your past life?

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We solved it by making a **reverse clock with time travel mode**, adding facial hair counting, random animal reincarnation detection, and useless animal sound effects ‚Äî because why not?
